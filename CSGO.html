 <p>Something CS:GO</p>

 <!-- We need to find out what content will go here -->
 <!-- This is where all the bot stuff goes -->
 <!-- Then are we going to use AJAX to communicate between the client and the server> -->
 <!-- We could go several ways with this:
      1) We could host bot on here that somehow links to steam.
      2) We could host a bot on a local computer that messes with steam.
      3) We could host the bot on your server and have it link to steam somehow.
      4) While I probably couldn't do it permanently, I could host a bot on my computer until we get a server for it. (which may not be neccessary.)
      
      There's still the matter of having it send commands to and from the website. The way I envision it is that people push a button on the website to place a bet.
      The bot then requests a trade from the steam client, they put in the amount of keys they want to bet. The higher amount of keys = the more likely you'll win.
      The bot then places this under their name and after the time for betting is up, there is a 2 or 3 minute wait period for any slackers and to make sure the system catches up fully so no key is left uncounted.
      The bot then picks a winner based on random luck. The odds are higher based off of how many keys are bet.
        for example: if it's a 100 key pot and someone places 35 keys inside the pot, that person has 35% chance of winning.
      Then, the winner is requested a trade by the bot and gives him all the keys. *or a % of it if there is a rake from you guys*
